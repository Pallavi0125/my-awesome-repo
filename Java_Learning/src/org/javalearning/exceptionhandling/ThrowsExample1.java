/*Throws Keyword: https://www.javatpoint.com/throws-keyword-and-difference-between-throw-and-throws
  The Java throws keyword is used to declare an exception. 
  It gives an information to the programmer that there may occur an exception 
  so it's better for the programmer to handle the code using try-catch block or throws keyword
  so that normal flow can be maintained.
   Syntax:  type method_name(parameters) throws exception_list
   
   1. throws keyword is used in the signature of method to indicate
      the listed type of exception which method might throws. 
   2. throws keyword is required only for checked exception and
      usage of throws keyword for unchecked exception is meaningless.
   3. Throws keyword is used to delegate the responsibilities of exception handling to caller method
   4. By using throws keyword it is possible to handle multiple exceptions,
      because one method is able to throws multiple exceptions at a time. 
   5. We can write throws keyword at method declaration level.
   6. We can provide the throws keyword only at method & constructor level 
      but not block level.
   7. throws is followed by a class and used with the method signature
