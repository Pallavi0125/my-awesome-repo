/*Type-casting: 
 * The process of converting one data-type to another data-type called as type-casting.
 * Types:
 * 1. Implicit type casting/ widening/Up casting
 * 2. Explicit type-casting/narrowing/down casting
 * Chart: 
 * Up-casting: 
 * Byte--> short--> Int--> long--> float--> double
 *                 /||\
 *                  ||
 *                 char
 * 
 * Down-casting:
 * Byte<-- short<-- Int<-- long<-- float<-- double
 *                  ||
 *                 \||/
 *                 char
 * Implicit type-casting/Up-casting: 
 * When we assign lower data type baue to higher data type that is called Up-casting.
 * No data loss during up-casting.
 * Compiler is responsible to perform implicit type-casting.
 * 
 * Explicit/Down type-casting:
 * When we assign higher data type value to lower data type that is called down type-casting.
 * There will be data loss during this type casting.
 * User is responsible to perform explicit type casting.
