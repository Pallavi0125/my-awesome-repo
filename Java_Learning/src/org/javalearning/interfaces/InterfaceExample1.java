/*Interface: 
 * Interface is used for complete abstraction and polymorphism.
 * Interface is by default Abstract and interface method is by default abstract method.
 * Interface is a type of class which contains only abstract methods and 
   these methods are by default public & abstract whether we are declaring or not.
 * Object creation not possible for interface also.
 * Interface is extension for abstract classes.
 * The interface is highlighting set of functionalities but implementations are hiding.
 * For interfaces also compiler will generate .class files after compilation.
 * Inside the source file it is possible to declare any number of interfaces
 * and we are declaring the interfaces by using 'Interface' keyword.
 * While providing implementation of interface methods , 
 * implementation methods must be public otherwise compiler will give error message.
 
 * NOTE: 
 * 1. If we don't know anything about implementation and just we have requirement specification
 *    then declare that requirements by using interface.
 * 2. If we know the implementation but not completely then we should use abstract classes.
 * 3. If we know the implementation completely then we should go for concrete/normal classes.
